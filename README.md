## Phishing Scanner
The Phishing Scanner app is designed to detect and assess potential phishing attacks based on provided URLs. This app utilizes a color-coded system to quickly inform users about the safety of a given URL:

- **Red Background**: Indicates that the URL is flagged for containing malware or phishing elements.
- **Green Background**: Indicates that the URL is safe and poses no known threat.
- **Yellow Background**: Indicates a warning status, suggesting potential risks associated with the URL.

### How It Works
